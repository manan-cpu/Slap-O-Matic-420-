Slap-O-Matic 420 🚀

"A Useless Machine That Packs a Punch!" 👋💥

😆 What is this monstrosity?

Slap-O-Matic 420 is a completely useless yet highly entertaining machine that exists solely to slap your hand—and you can't escape it! 😈

✅ A fake countdown that tricks you into thinking you have time…
✅ A random slap attack so you NEVER win…
✅ A buzzer & LED that activate at random, adding extra chaos!
✅ FAST slap down, painfully slow reset for maximum disrespect.
✅ Hilarious LCD messages roasting your reaction time. 💀

🎮 How It Works

The LCD shows a fake countdown (e.g., "10 sec left!") to trick you.

The Slap-O-Matic randomly slaps at any time before the countdown ends.

The LED and buzzer turn on randomly for extra confusion.

The motor slaps FAST and then returns SLOWLY, mocking your existence.

The LCD displays a funny insult like "Too slow!" or "Hope that left a mark!" 😂
